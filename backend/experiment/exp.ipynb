Djokovic, a 24-time major champion from Serbia, had hinted at his impending retirement following his French Open loss last month in the same round, also to Sinner, when he said it could have been \"the last match ever I played here.\" While Djokovic admitted Friday that he had been physically compromised \"quite a bit\" during the match -- without offering any specifics -- and said how difficult it has been to lose to Sinner and Alcaraz in recent meetings, he said he believed he was still playing well at Grand Slams.',\n",
